                <p className='indent-10 break-all'>React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL. Let us create a simple application to React to understand how the React Router works. The application will contain three components: home component, about a component, and contact component. We will use React Router to navigate between these components. React Router, and dynamic, client-side routing, allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates. React Router uses component structure to call components, which display the appropriate information.</p>

                <p className='indent-10 break-all'>The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux. React.createContext() is all you need. It returns a consumer and a provider. Provider is a component that as it's names suggests provides the state to its children. It will hold the "store" and be the parent of all the components that might need that store. Consumer as it so happens is a component that consumes and uses the state</p>

                <p className='indent-10 break-all'>The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly. The useRef returns a mutable ref object. This object has a property called .current. The value is persisted in the refContainer.current property. These values are accessed from the current property of the returned object. The .current property could be initialised to the passed argument initialValue e.g. useRef(initialValue). The object can persist a value for a full lifetime of the component. </p>
